# Smashtag  [CS 193P]
This project is a solution to Assignment 4 and 5 of CS 193P [Spring 2016]. It is a fully functional Twitter search engine. It uses Stanford's own Twitter framework since the purpose of the assignments is to learn about iOS's own frameworks, views, Core Data, etc.  Here's a link to the assignments for reference: [Smashtag Assignments](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/lganttyxwc614s6/AAD_OIprAIw8oRWysLOTCkWMa?dl=0)

## Building

You'll need [Stanford's Twitter Framework](https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs193p/Twitter.zip) as well as Xcode 7 and an iOS 9 device or iOS9 simulator images. From Stanford's instructions: "...you must create a workspace in Xcode that contains both your Smashtag project and the provided Twitter framework project. The two projects must be siblings (not have an ancestral relationship to each other) in the workspace. You will also need to drag the Twitter framework (from the navigation pane of your workspace) into the General tab of your Smashtag Project Settings under Embedded Binaries."
